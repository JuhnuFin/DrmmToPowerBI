# About
This project is a cooperation between Datto and myself. The PowerShell scripts in this project will allow you to pull data from Datto RMM and store in a database, making it possible to create historical dashboards or reports in PowerBI.
# Prerequisites
## SQL
You'll need a Microsoft SQL server to store the Datto RMM data. You can download [SQL express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) for testing. Store the SQL credentials in the provide registry import file.
## API
You'll need to create API keys to run the PowerShell scripts. Find more information how to create API keys in the [Datto Online Help](https://help.aem.autotask.net/en/Content/2SETUP/APIv2.htm). Store the API keys in the provide registry file.
